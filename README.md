mf-geoadmin3
============

next generation map.geo.admin.ch

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geoadmin/mf-geoadmin3.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geoadmin/mf-geoadmin3)

# Getting started

Checkout the source code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/geoadmin/mf-geoadmin3.git

or when you're using ssh key (see https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys):

    $ git clone git@github.com:geoadmin/mf-geoadmin3.git

Build:

    $ make all

Use `make help` to know about the possible `make` targets and the currently set variables:

    $ make help

Use `make translate` to import directly translations from the googlespreadshhet. Don't forget to set up first these 2 following environment parameter:
    
    export DRIVE_USER=your_login
    export DRIVE_PWD=your_password

Variables have sensible default values for development. Anyhow, they can be set as make macros or envvars. For example:

    $ make APACHE_BASE_PATH=elemoine apache 
    $ APACHE_BASE_PATH=elemoine make 

You can customize the build by creating an `rc` file that you source once. Ex:  

    $ cat rc_elemoine 
    export APACHE_BASE_PATH=mypath
    export APACHE_BASE_DIRECTORY=/home/elemoine/mf-geoadmin3
    export API_URL=//mf-chsdi.3dev.bgdi.ch
    export DEPLOY_TARGET=dev
    $ source rc_elemoine 
    $ make  

For builds on test (rc_dev), integration (rc_int) and production (rc_prod), you
should source the corresponding `rc` file.

On mf0t, create an Apache configuration file for your environment. Ex:

    $ cat /var/www/vhosts/mf-geoadmin3/conf/00-elemoine.conf
    Include /home/elemoine/mf-geoadmin3/apache/*.conf 

## Dependencies

The GeoAdmin team development servers all contain the necessary dependencies
to develop mf-geoadmin3. Even if developement of the project outside of the
GeoAdmin infrastructure is not fully supported (e.g. you would need to
setup your own web server with correct configurations), you should still
be able to build the project on a different, Linux based infrastructure. For
this to work, you need to make sure to install the following dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties 
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js 
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install make gcc+ git unzip openjdk-6-jre openjdk-6-jdk g++
    nodejs python-virtualenv
    npm install phantomjs

# Deploying project and branches

## Deploying the project (branch *master*)

Use the geoadmin3 script found in this git repositry: https://github.com/geoadmin/deploy

Note: we should NOT manually adapt code in /var/www/vhosts/mf-geoadmin3 directory

## Deploying a branch

Use `make deploybranch` *in your working directory* to deploy your current 
branch to test (Use `make deploybranchint` to also deploy it to integration).
The code for deployment, however, does not come from your working directory,
but does get cloned (first time) or pulled (if done once) *directly from github*.
So you'll likely use this command *after* you push your branch to github.

Use `make deploybranch GIT_BRANCH=dev_other_branch` to deploy a different 
branch than the one you are currently working on. Make sure that the branch 
specified exists on github.

The first time you use the command will take some time to execute.

The code of the deployed branch is in a specific directory 
`/var/www/vhosts/mf-geoadmin3/private/branch` on both test and integration.
The command adds a branch specific configuration to
`/var/www/vhosts/mf-geoadmin3/conf`. This way, the deployed branch
behaves exactly the same as any user specific deploy.

Sample path:
http://mf-geoadmin3.int.bgdi.ch/dev_bottombar/prod

Please only use integration url for external communication (including here on 
github), even though the exact same structure is also available on our test 
instances.

### Get correct link the API
Per default, the API used in the **main** instance of mf-chsdi3. If you want
to target a specific branch of mf-chsdi3, please adapt the `API_URL` variable
in the `rc_branch.mako` file on **your branch**
